# The Quantum Collective — Landing Page

The landing page for **The Quantum Collective**, the private, members-only network for funded
quantum founders ($300/month). Built with React + Vite. Copy is sourced from
`quantum_round_premium_strategy.pdf`; the section structure follows the page blueprint in
`SPA.jpg` (03 Hero · 04 Problem · 05 Story · 06 Proof · 07 Features · 08 CTA).

## Stack

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) + [React](https://react.dev/) + [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- Self-hosted fonts via Fontsource (Fraunces, Hanken Grotesk, IBM Plex Mono) — no third-party requests
- No CSS framework — hand-written design system in `src/styles/`

### Palette (strict 60/20/10/10)

| Token | Hex | Share | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--parchment` | `#E7E1D4` | 60% | Base canvas / backgrounds |
| `--chestnut` | `#B0664E` | 20% | CTAs, highlights, active states |
| `--mushroom` | `#A4988C` | 10% | Borders, dividers, section bands |
| `--obsidian` | `#05040B` | 10% | Text, headings, footer |

Defined as CSS custom properties in `src/styles/tokens.css`. Contrast notes: body text is
Obsidian on Parchment (≈16:1); buttons use Obsidian labels on Chestnut fills (≈4.7:1, AA);
Mushroom is decorative-only on light ground and is used for muted text only on the Obsidian
footer (≈7:1). Small chestnut-toned labels use `--chestnut-ink` (#8B5340), a pressed shade of
Chestnut that passes AA (≈4.7:1) on Parchment — pure Chestnut text appears only at large sizes.

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Build

```bash
npm run build    # outputs to dist/
npm run preview  # serve the production build locally
```

## Routes

- `/` — the landing page
- `/apply` — placeholder membership application (no backend wired yet; the submit handler in
  `src/pages/Apply.jsx` is where to connect a form service)
- `/#signal` — The Signal free-newsletter capture (same placeholder note)

## Deploying to AWS Amplify Hosting (GitHub CI/CD)

The repo includes the two files Amplify reads:

- **`amplify.yml`** — build spec: `npm ci`, `npm run build`, artifacts from `dist/`,
  `node_modules` cached, Node pinned to 22 via `nvm use`.
- **`customHttp.yml`** — security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, nosniff, Referrer-Policy,
  Permissions-Policy).

Setup:

1. In the Amplify console, **Create new app → GitHub** and select
   `AltivumInc-Admin/tqc`, branch `main`. Amplify detects Vite and uses the committed
   `amplify.yml`.
2. **SPA routing**: Amplify auto-creates a 200 rewrite for detected SPAs. If deep links such as
   `/apply` ever 404, add this rule under **Hosting → Rewrites and redirects**:
   - Source: `</^[^.]+$|\.(?!(css|gif|ico|jpg|js|png|txt|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|map|json|webp)$)([^.]+$)/>`
   - Target: `/index.html` · Type: `200 (Rewrite)`
3. Every push to `main` triggers a build and deploy.
