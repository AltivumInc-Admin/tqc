const FAQS = [
  {
    q: 'Why pay $300 a month when free quantum communities exist?',
    a: 'Five structural reasons. Curation creates the signal floor open Discords can never reach. Payment creates skin in the game — paying members show up and share real information. Confidentiality is enforced, which makes conversations about burn, down rounds, and disputes possible. Warm capital intros have asymmetric value — one term sheet can return years of fees. And structured peer accountability with founders who actually understand quantum milestones has no free equivalent.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What do I get for bringing another founder in?',
    a: 'A month free. Refer a founder who passes vetting and joins, and your next month’s membership is waived. The network grows by vouching — and vouching is rewarded.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Who qualifies for The Round?',
    a: 'Founders and co-founders of operating quantum startups — across hardware, software, sensing, networking, and post-quantum. Funding stage is not the bar; the vetting is. If you’re building a real quantum company, apply — and The Signal stays free for every quantum builder either way.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I’m an engineer, researcher, or investor. Is there a place for me?',
    a: 'Yes — The Signal is free and open to every quantum builder: the newsletter, public webinars, and the open community channel. Investors and ecosystem allies participate through the Patrons & Partners tier — valuable to the network, never seated inside the confidential peer circles.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How confidential is it, really?',
    a: 'A plain-language member agreement is required at join, and peer circles run under enforced, Chatham House-style norms. Quantum is small and competitive — confidentiality isn’t a feature of the product, it is the product.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I expense it?',
    a: 'Most members can. At $3,600 a year, membership costs less than a single conference trip with travel — and quantum founders typically spend $3,000–$10,000 a year on the circuit.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What does the founding cohort get?',
    a: 'A locked-in founding rate that never goes up, a permanent founding badge, and a real hand in shaping the network. Early members are helping build the room they’re paying for — the terms acknowledge that.',
