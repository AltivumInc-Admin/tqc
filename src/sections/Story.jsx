              Quantum is consolidating into roughly <strong>45 dense clusters that capture 96%
              of global funding</strong>, and capital is flooding in — billion-dollar state
              initiatives, half-billion-dollar venture programs, government commitments past
              $10B. Yet the founder population is still small enough that one network can
              credibly know, and convene, most of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              That window does not stay open. <strong>Whoever becomes the default room for
              quantum founders now owns that position as the field grows tenfold.</strong> The
              Quantum Collective exists to be that room — recruited founder by founder, vetted
              application by application, starting with a founding cohort of 15–25.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is operated by Christian Perez, founder of Altivum Inc. — a Green Beret veteran
              who builds quantum systems on AWS. Military trust, technical depth in the stack you
              run on, and fluency with the cloud platforms racing to win quantum: the rare
              combination it takes to curate a room founders take seriously, and sponsors fund.

              exist yet.”

                A hand-picked founding cohort, curated peer circles, expert sessions arranged
                personally, and an Operator’s Library written from real quantum-on-AWS
                experience. Small — and high-signal by construction.

              <p>
                Early members are helping build the network they’re paying for — so founding
                members join at a locked-in rate that never goes up, and carry the founding badge
                permanently. Early belief, rewarded.
